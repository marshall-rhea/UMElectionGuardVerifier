# errand_share

Quarantining is most effective when everybody stays inside but
some essential errands necessitate that we leave our homes. The goal of ErrandShare
is to help users maximize each trip out of the house by allowing other nearby users to
piggyback their own errands on the trip. The service is designed to be give and take:
this time you may give your time and efforts but next time you may be the one to benefit
from another user. ErrandShare will also employ a token system to incentive individuals
to accept requests by rewarding bounty fulfillers and removing tokens from bounty
posters.

NOTE: This is a mobile flutter application currently targeted for Android devices. 
To run it locally, first install the ([Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)) and [Android Studio tools](https://developer.android.com/studio).
Next, install and run a simulator or plug in a device. In a terminal, type 'flutter run'
in the ErrandShare directory. For trouble shooting try 'flutter doctor', 'flutter devices',
and 'flutter emulator'.
